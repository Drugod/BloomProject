You need GZDoom 3.2.1 minimum or Zandronum 2.8+ to run this mod, within any Doom IWAD files though, plus
a compatible gpu with 3.3 GL shaders minimum. It also works on GZDoom 3.7.2, LZDoom 3.82 (you can't throw
grenades), QZDoom 2.1pre-4493 (you can't throw grenades and performance is bad with models/voxels) and
new versions of Zandronum most probably.

Check SOURCE folder for a complete and exhaustive list of materials used on this mod,
plus a long detailed story background and Bible.

This mod wouldn't have been possible without ZBlood and ZBloodX, so thanks a lot again to
IvanDobrovski/Cruduxy/Marinelol and their respective creators

## KNOWN PROBLEMS/LIMITS/BUGS:
- GZDoom: Tested under GZDoom 3.2.1 x64, 3.7.2 x64 and latest builds, no problems yet
- LZDoom: You can't throw grenades
- QZDoom: You can't throw grenades, bad performance in general
- Zandronum: Tested under Zandro 2.8pre-441 and 3-1alpha-441, maybe some lights acts differently but no problems yet
- IWADS are still broken in certain occasions, since we use monster replacements you can't beat maps like MAP07 in Doom 2
