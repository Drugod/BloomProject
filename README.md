This repository belongs to BLOOM TEAM, I have just provided my knowledge into github 
usage with permission to publish his project here, so we can have also a mutual
workflow together (and possibly invite other people to contribute).

A thread has been opened on ZDoom Forums recently, check it out and give us feedbacks!

You need GZDoom 3.7.2 or Zandronum 2.8+ to run this mod, within any Doom IWAD files though.

Check DOCS & CREDITS folders for a complete and exhaustive list of materials used on this mod,
plus a long detailed story about its development.

All borrowed resources present in this repo belong ONLY to respective owners/creators.

This mod wouldn't have been possible without ZBlood, so thanks a lot again to
