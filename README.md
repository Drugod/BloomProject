This repository belongs to BLOOM TEAM, and it has been converted as Private repository since
07/12/2019 due to some problems noticed with people sharing the project without our approval.
If you can read this, it is really strange since you are not allowed to browse the repo, but
it could also mean that we have released BlooM and so that's why.

Thanks to Ozymandias81 to have provide his knowledge to have this repository open and working
as public for several months in order to release the Demo in time for Halloween 2019.

We have a website for this mod, check it asap: https://www.bloomteam666.com

You need GZDoom 3.2.1 minimum or Zandronum 2.8+ to run this mod, within any Doom IWAD files though, plus
a compatible gpu with 3.3 GL shaders minimum. It also works on GZDoom 3.7.2, LZDoom 3.82 (you can't throw
grenades), QZDoom 2.1pre-4493 (you can't throw grenades and performance is bad with models/voxels) and
new versions of Zandronum most probably. These were requirements for Demo release.
Now it also work under GLesZDoom 4.6.0+, GZDoom 3.7.2 still recommended.

Check SOURCE folder for a complete and exhaustive list of materials used on this mod,
plus a long detailed story background and Bible.
