You need GZDoom 3.2.1 minimum or Zandronum 2.8+ to run this mod, within any Doom IWAD files though, plus
a compatible gpu with 3.3 GL shaders minimum. It also works on GZDoom 3.7.2, LZDoom 3.82 (you can't throw
grenades), QZDoom 2.1pre-4493 (you can't throw grenades and performance is bad with models/voxels) and 
new versions of Zandronum most probably.

Check SOURCE folder for a complete and exhaustive list of materials used on this mod,
plus a long detailed story background and Bible.

This mod wouldn't have been possible without ZBlood and ZBloodX, so thanks a lot again to
IvanDobrovski/Cruduxy and Marinelol
