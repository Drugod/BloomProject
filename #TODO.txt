For Rolls, models which needs to be added:
- nothing yet

For All:
- Bloodjar and Bloodpile actors share the same behavior and sprite... What's the point?
- fix GLDEFS for Doom enemies (RevenantTracer, Spidermastermind, others) and skullstaff, check other stuff
- fix HUD statusbar for gzdoom 4+
- fix SpiderMother code
- fix TERRAIN defs, lots of sounds needs to be defined and included
- polish overall code
- reduce size of models skins, 1000x1000 is very engine intensive, 512x512 should be okay... We must figure how to not break quality though
- remove unused stuff
- there are a couple of unused voxels yet, and possibly models
- tweak special effects, bleeding effects and amount of used actors per maps
- verify if unified PNAMES works

Coop problems:
- test new Berserk_ behavior for Zandro in coop, sinec it has a checkclass for Pickup2 state
- fix CultFire sounds for Zandro, marinelol said "server crashes about an infinite loop caused by fire cultists" (the actor has been fixed, needs tests)

Zandro test required:
- check always maps from Zandronum first :(
- externalize KEYCONF between LANGUAGE and MENUDEF (if supported by zandro)
- fix LifeLeech for Zandronum: fire states originate some unknown flags messages, probably cause by non-existent GunFlash calls or maybe Acs calls
