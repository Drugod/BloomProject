For Rolls, models which needs to be added:
- nothing yet

For All:
- add Blood items related 3d models
- Bloodjar and Bloodpile actors share the same behavior and sprite... What's the point?
- check always maps from Zandronum first :(
- convert all models as md3 and try reducing polys total (not important, just a nitpick and it would require lots of time)
- externalize KEYCONF between LANGUAGE and MENUDEF (if supported by zandro)
- fix Berserk_ behavior for Zandro coop: cruduxy/marinelol said that it crashes once you pick it up, so I guess we should call a script for Pickup2 state jump
- fix Cultists looping fire sounds for Zandro, marinelol said "server crashes about an infinite loop caused by fire cultists"
- fix Gargovile/FlyingGargovile health while performing Summon states
- fix GLDEFS for Doom enemies (RevenantTracer, Spidermastermind, others) and skullstaff, check other stuff
- fix LifeLeech for Zandronum: fire states originate some unknown flags messages, probably cause by non-existent GunFlash calls or maybe Acs calls
- fix TERRAIN defs, lots of sounds needs to be defined and included
- fix HUD statusbar for gzdoom 4+
- fix SpiderMother code
- polish overall code
- reduce size of models skins, 1000x1000 is very engine intensive, 512x512 should be okay... We must figure how to not break quality though
- remove unused stuff
- there are a pletora of models that needs to be coded yet, just check inside Models/Doom and Models/Blood
- tweak special effects, bleeding effects and amount of used actors per maps
- verify if unified PNAMES works
