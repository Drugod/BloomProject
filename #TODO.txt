For Rolls, models which needs to be added:
- pistol_ actor (not sure if needed due pistolstart, but doesn't have any 3d model)

For All:
- Caleb weapons needs to be fixed, some are swapped or useless, and the Life Leech has a wrong primary fire mode (same of secondary)
- add Blood weapons and items related 3d models
- add Doom items related 3d models
- add a Caleb replacement for pistol_ actor (there are any for it)
- convert all models as md3 and try reducing polys total (not important, just a nitpick and it would require lots of time)
- externalize KEYCONF between LANGUAGE and MENUDEF (if supported by zandro)
- fix GLDEFS for Baronwolf and skullstaff, check other stuff
- fix TERRAIN defs, lots of sounds needs to be defined and included, instead to use Enjay ones I will probably go for reuse Gore defs
- fix HUD statusbar for gzdoom
- fix SpiderMother code
- get rid of numbered scripts from libraries so we don't fall to use some on maps already (use named ones only, so mappers are free)
- polish overall code
- reduce size of models skins, 1000x1000 is very engine intensive, 512x512 should be okay... We must figure how to not break quality though
- remove unused stuff
- there are a pletora of models that needs to be coded yet, just check inside Models/Doom
- tweak special effects, bleeding effects and amount of used actors per maps, or at least create something that limits how much far you can see them (DistanceCheck on GZDoom)
- verify if unified PNAMES works
