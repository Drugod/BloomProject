For Rolls, models which needs to be added:
- add burning plus shock and swimming frames to RatDemons
- add crouch frames for Caleb and swimming frames for both classes
- add pickup sprites for GrenadeBox plus voxel and 3d model
- add swimming frames and underwater attack frames to Doom humans enemies

For All:
- add flamethrower / freezethrower for Doomguy using beta sprites
- Bloodjar and Bloodpile actors share the same behavior and sprite... What's the point?
- fix Doom paletted sprites, mainly HUD ones and Player
- fix GLDEFS for Doom enemies (RevenantTracer, Spidermastermind, others) and skullstaff, check other stuff
- fix HUD statusbar for gzdoom 4+
- fix LifeLeech: fire states originate some unknown flags messages, when actors like Archies or Ghouls gets hit
- fix TERRAIN defs, lots of sounds needs to be defined and included
- polish overall code
- reduce size of models skins, 1000x1000 is very engine intensive, 512x512 should be okay... We must figure how to not break quality though
- remove unused stuff
- there are a couple of unused voxels yet, and possibly models
- tweak special effects, bleeding effects and amount of used actors per maps
- Add new ammo for flamethrower, actually uses spraycan
- Add dropitem new ammo for flamethrower (fire cultimp) and the flamerthrower (mancubus/hybrids)
- Improve flamethrower sprites

Coop problems:
- verify Berserk_ behavior for Zandro	
- verify CultFire sounds for Zandro

Zandro test required:
- check always maps from Zandronum first :(
- externalize KEYCONF between LANGUAGE and MENUDEF (if supported by zandro)

Reminder for actors behaviour:
- All bodies which fall over skies should fade immediately
- Bats, spiders and rats shouldn't be able to swim underwater
- BatSouls also shouldn't be able to swim
- Creatures which are able to jump shouldn't swim as well, beside RatDemons
- Jumping creatures and little ones such as spiders or rats should die immediately over skies (GargoDemon, RatDemons, SpiderMother too)
