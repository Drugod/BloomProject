For Rolls:
- add burning plus shock and swimming frames to RatDemons
- add crouch frames for Caleb and swimming frames for both classes
- add pickup sprites for GrenadeBox plus voxel and 3d model
- add swimming frames and underwater attack frames to Doom humans enemies

For All:
- add dropitem new ammo for flamethrower (fire cultimp) and the flamerthrower (mancubus/hybrids)
- filter Choking hand possession only human species not possessed yet
- fix Doomguy skin palette
- fix GLDEFS for Doom enemies (RevenantTracer, Spidermastermind, others) and LifeLeech, check other stuff
- fix HUD statusbar for gzdoom 4+, or use GZDoom 3.7.2
- fix TERRAIN defs, lots of sounds needs to be defined and included
- polish overall code
- reduce size of models skins, 1000x1000 is very engine intensive, 512x512 should be okay... We must figure how to not break quality though
- remove unused stuff
- tweak special effects, bleeding effects and amount of used actors per maps

For Zandro:
- check always maps from Zandronum first :(
- externalize KEYCONF between LANGUAGE and MENUDEF (if supported by zandro)
- fix LifeLeech: fire states originate some unknown flags messages, when actors like Archies or Ghouls gets hit
- verify Berserk_ behavior for Zandro (coop)
- verify CultFire sounds for Zandro (coop)
- verify scripted events (coop)

Reminder for actors behaviour:
- All bodies which fall over skies should fade immediately
- Bats, spiders and rats shouldn't be able to swim underwater
- Creatures which are able to jump shouldn't swim as well, beside RatDemons
- Jumping creatures and little ones such as spiders or rats should die immediately over skies (GargoDemon, RatDemons, SpiderMother too)
- Some randomizers like to spawn enemies in the void or in the sky, noticeable on BLM01 sometimes

Minor things:
- Test BlooM under GLesZDoom, QZDoom and LZDoom

Know Bugs:

- When a Possesed zombieman is killed under water, the hand flying off his head does not die (and continuously babbles) until the player crushes it.
- Arachnopods of any kind often start jumping up and down incessantly. And already can not move normally.
- I'm not sure if it's worth shielding it with a bug. Proximity dynamite works even on enemies standing behind obstacles (for example, a door), of course, without causing     damage to them. Which makes it very difficult to set traps with this type of weapon.
- When picking up Proximity Dynamite, an item (in the native interface that does not have an icon) appears in the inventory, which allows you to take it in your hand. I'm not sure if that's what it was meant to be.
