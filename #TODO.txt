For All:
- add dropitem new ammo for flamethrower (fire cultimp) and the flamerthrower (mancubus/hybrids)
- fix Doomguy skin palette
- fix GLDEFS for Doom enemies (RevenantTracer, Spidermastermind, others) and LifeLeech, check other stuff
- fix HUD statusbar for gzdoom 4+, or use GZDoom 3.7.2
- fix TERRAIN defs, lots of sounds needs to be defined and included
- polish overall code
- reduce size of models skins, 1000x1000 is very engine intensive, 512x512 should be okay... We must figure how to not break quality though
- remove unused stuff
- there are a couple of unused voxels yet, and possibly models
- tweak special effects, bleeding effects and amount of used actors per maps
- Filter Choking hand possession only human species not possessed yet

Coop problems:
- verify Berserk_ behavior for Zandro
- verify CultFire sounds for Zandro

Zandro test required:
- check always maps from Zandronum first :(
- externalize KEYCONF between LANGUAGE and MENUDEF (if supported by zandro)
- fix LifeLeech: fire states originate some unknown flags messages, when actors like Archies or Ghouls gets hit

Reminder for actors behaviour:
- All bodies which fall over skies should fade immediately
- Bats, spiders and rats shouldn't be able to swim underwater
- Creatures which are able to jump shouldn't swim as well, beside RatDemons
- Jumping creatures and little ones such as spiders or rats should die immediately over skies (GargoDemon, RatDemons, SpiderMother too)
- Some randomizers like to spawn enemies in the void or in the sky, noticeable on BLM01 sometimes

Minor things:
- Test BlooM under GLesZDoom, QZDoom and LZDoom
