For Rolls:
- add burning plus shock and swimming frames to RatDemons
- add crouch frames for Caleb and swimming frames for both classes
- add pickup sprites for GrenadeBox plus voxel and 3d model
- add swimming frames and underwater attack frames to Doom humans enemies

For Drugod:
- Add NHT to the menu credits in the music
- Change from Rolls to Rolls3D in the menu credits
- Changes from 3Drolls to Rolls3D in the ending credits
- Make that the statusbar of the player disappear once you defeat the final boss, so it doesn't appear during the ending screen and final credits

For All:
- add dropitem new ammo for flamethrower (fire cultimp) and the flamerthrower (mancubus/hybrids)
- filter Choking hand possession only human species not possessed yet
- fix Doomguy skin palette
- fix GLDEFS for Doom enemies (RevenantTracer, Spidermastermind, others) and LifeLeech, check other stuff
- fix HUD statusbar for gzdoom 4+, or use GZDoom 3.7.2
- fix TERRAIN defs, lots of sounds needs to be defined and included
- polish overall code
- reduce size of models skins, 1000x1000 is very engine intensive, 512x512 should be okay... We must figure how to not break quality though
- remove unused stuff
- tweak special effects, bleeding effects and amount of used actors per maps

For Zandro:
- check always maps from Zandronum first :(
- externalize KEYCONF between LANGUAGE and MENUDEF (if supported by zandro)
- fix LifeLeech: fire states originate some unknown flags messages, when actors like Archies or Ghouls gets hit
- verify Berserk_ behavior for Zandro (coop)
- verify CultFire sounds for Zandro (coop)
- verify scripted events (coop)

Reminder for actors behaviour:
- All bodies which fall over skies should fade immediately
- Bats, spiders and rats shouldn't be able to swim underwater
- Creatures which are able to jump shouldn't swim as well, beside RatDemons
- Jumping creatures and little ones such as spiders or rats should die immediately over skies (GargoDemon, RatDemons, SpiderMother too)
- Some randomizers like to spawn enemies in the void or in the sky, noticeable on BLM01 sometimes

Minor things:
- Test BlooM under GLesZDoom, QZDoom and LZDoom
