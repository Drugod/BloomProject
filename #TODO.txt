For Rolls, models which needs to be added:
- a_boxbullet.md3 needs a skin
- a_fewbullet.md3 needs a better skin
- colt needs 3d model
- pistol_ needs a 3d model
- singleshotgun needs a 3d model
- teslacharge voxel and teslachargebox voxel + model

For All:
- Caleb weapons needs to be fixed, some are swapped or useless, and the Life Leech has a wrong primary fire mode (same of secondary)
- add Blood weapons and items related 3d models
- add Doom items related 3d models
- add a Caleb replacement for pistol_ actor (there are any for it)
- convert all models as md3 and try reducing polys total (not important, just a nitpick and it would require lots of time)
- externalize KEYCONF between LANGUAGE and MENUDEF (if supported by zandro)
- fix GLDEFS for Doom enemies (RevenantTracer, Spidermastermind, others) and skullstaff, check other stuff
- fix TERRAIN defs, lots of sounds needs to be defined and included, instead to use Enjay ones I will probably go for reuse Gore defs
- fix HUD statusbar for gzdoom
- fix SpiderMother code
- polish overall code
- reduce size of models skins, 1000x1000 is very engine intensive, 512x512 should be okay... We must figure how to not break quality though
- remove unused stuff
- there are a pletora of models that needs to be coded yet, just check inside Models/Doom and Models/Blood
- tweak special effects, bleeding effects and amount of used actors per maps
- verify if unified PNAMES works
