## REPOSITORY STORY:
This repository belongs to BLOOM TEAM, and it has been converted as Private repository since
07/12/2019 due to some problems noticed with people sharing the project without our approval.
If you can read this, it is really strange since you are not allowed to browse the repo, but
it could also mean that we have released BlooM and so that's why.

Thanks to Ozymandias81 to have provide his knowledge to have this repository open and working
as public for several months in order to release the Demo in time for Halloween 2019. And now
we have brought to you the complete project for Halloween 2021, what else?!

We have a website for this mod, check it asap: https://www.bloomteam666.com

Also exists a ModDB page for it too: https://www.moddb.com/mods/bloom-doomblood-crossover

There are also threads on ZDoom Forums and Doomworld, check 'em out and give us feedbacks!

You need GZDoom 3.2.1 minimum or Zandronum 2.8+ to run this mod, within any Doom IWAD files though, plus
a compatible gpu with 3.3 GL shaders minimum. It also works on GZDoom 3.7.2, LZDoom 3.82 (you can't throw
grenades), QZDoom 2.1pre-4493 (you can't throw grenades and performance is bad with models/voxels) and
new versions of Zandronum most probably. These were requirements for Demo release.
Now it also work under GLesZDoom 4.6.0+, GZDoom 3.7.2 still recommended, runs flawlessly on Zandronum.

Check SOURCE folder for a complete and exhaustive list of materials used on this mod,
plus a long detailed story background and Bible.

All borrowed resources present in this project belong ONLY to respective owners/creators, if we have miss
someone let us know, but with proof.

This mod wouldn't have been possible without ZBlood and ZBloodX, so thanks a lot again to
IvanDobrovski/Cruduxy/Marinelol and their respective creators
